 Codex Loop
 
 Please utilize implementation agents to implement this plan. Then use agents to give it a code review to ensure everything was completed as well as is upto our code quality standards. Create a to do list of every item and check it off as you go. You yourself give a final review, after the agents say they are complete. Let the agents run in a loop until they get all tests passsing. Give me an update at the end.


Claude Update goldens/stage trace

 Please REGENERATE the springfield fixtures and run the stage trace test and give me an update on our pdf extraction pipeline. Show me scorecard. We want to start diagnosing at the furthest upstream point and debugging from the furthest upstream point, we aren't worried about the downstream failures as they are a result of the upstream ones. Utilize agents for all tasks and exploration so we can preserve context window.
