# Construction Inspector App

Cross-platform mobile/desktop app for construction inspectors. Offline-first with cloud sync.

**HARD CONSTRAINT: Security is non-negotiable. No shortcuts that bypass approval flows, weaken RLS, or create privilege escalation paths.**

## Project Structure

## Quick Reference Commands

**CRITICAL**: Git Bash silently fails on Flutter. ALWAYS use pwsh wrapper.

### Build & Run
1. `pwsh -File tools/build.ps1 -Platform android` — Release APK
2. `pwsh -File tools/build.ps1 -Platform windows` — Windows build
3. `pwsh -File tools/build.ps1 -Platform android -BuildType debug` — Debug APK
4. `pwsh -Command "flutter run -d windows"` — Desktop dev

### Testing & Diagnostics
5. `pwsh -Command "flutter test"` — All tests
6. `pwsh -Command "flutter pub get"` — Get dependencies
7. `pwsh -Command "flutter analyze"` — Static analysis

### Supabase CLI
8. `npx supabase db push` — Push pending migrations to remote
9. `npx supabase db pull` — Pull remote schema changes
10. `npx supabase db diff` — Diff local vs remote schema

### Process Management
11. `pwsh -Command "Stop-Process -Name 'construction_inspector' -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue"` — Kill app ONLY

### Common Mistakes
- NEVER run flutter/dart directly in Git Bash — ALWAYS use `pwsh -Command "..."`
- NEVER use wc, sed, awk, grep as Bash — use Read/Edit/Grep tools instead
- ALWAYS use `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` on Stop-Process
- ALWAYS set `timeout: 600000` on `flutter run` commands (default 120s too short)
- ALWAYS quote paths with spaces
- **NEVER run `Stop-Process -Name 'dart'`** — kills MCP servers. Only kill `construction_inspector`.

## Session & Workflow
- `/resume-session` — Load HOT context | `/end-session` — Save state with auto-archiving
- State: `.claude/autoload/_state.md` | Defects: `.claude/defects/_defects-{feature}.md` (max 5 per feature)
- Git: Feature branches only, never commit to main. `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge --squash`
- Planning pipeline: `brainstorming` (spec) → `writing-plans` (plan) → `implement` (execute)
- **Sizing guide:** XS (single-file mechanical) = no skill needed | S (up to 3 files, known pattern) = skip brainstorming + writing-plans | M+ = full pipeline. Security-sensitive changes (auth, RLS, sync, data exposure) always require full pipeline regardless of size.

`.claude/` is gitignored from app repo and tracked separately.

## Context Efficiency
- **Prefer parallel Agent calls** over `run_in_background`.
- Cap **Explore agents at 3 per session**. Only spawn subagents for 5+ tool-call tasks.
- Don't echo back file contents already in context. Prefer file:line references over code blocks.
- Summarize subagent results in 3-5 bullets, not full output.
